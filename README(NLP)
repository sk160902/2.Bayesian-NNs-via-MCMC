Firstly the datasets module was imported from python library.
Gathered information regarding all the datasets that were present and verified if the 'trec' dataset present among them.
Loaded the 'trec' dataset into the colab.
Since the dataset was in dictionary format use of pandas wasn't possible,hence had to iterate through the dictionary,appended it into an empty list and created a dataframe from it.
Imported accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics module to note the performance achieved before and after mixup,the prformance achieved rose by 1% after mixup which implies that the model could be predicted more accurately with the mixup strategy in place.
For augmenting sentences using discrete augmentation techniques: synonym  replacement:used the trained module nltk.corpus to import the wordnet library,defined a function,first to get synonyms of a particular word in that sentence then defined another function to replace the synonyms in that sentence. 
word dropping: defined a function under 3 subparts following the given conditions: 1.) If there is only one word,keep it 2.) To randomly delete words with probability p and 3.)To return a random word if in case all words were deleted.
